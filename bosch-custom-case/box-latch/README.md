# Description

This is a replacement latch for [Bosch Custom Case][bosch-custom-case] / Pick
and Click bit storage boxes.

## Printing

The latch flexes in normal use. I printed this with 3 perimeters for strength.
Latches printed with PLA seem to work, although I prefer PETG for these.

Printing with a concentric bottom fill pattern makes a nice look for this print.

## Installation

Simply snap the latch onto the box's latch clip!
