# Description

Put the "custom" into your [Bosch Custom Case][bosch-custom-case] with custom
3D-printed bit clips! These cases have slots for swappable clips of drill and
drive bits, but the OEM clips are only available with bits included. Create your
own bit clips with this model!

## Features

* Up to **9** bit slots per clip -- OEM clips only have 8 slots
* Select between slots for quick change or driver insert bits
* Optionally stack two rows of bits in one clip (up to 18 total bits)
* Optionally point bit slots downward for easier bit storage at the top of your
  case
* Optionally add a blank channel to part of a clip for long bit pass through

## Rendering and Printing

Open `custom-case-bits-insert.scad` in OpenSCAD, and use the Customizer options
to configure your bit clip:

Bit clips print with no supports. Bit slot walls bend slightly when
inserting/removing bits, so I like printing my clips using PETG. PLA should also
work fine.
