## Description

These are parametric Gridfinity bins for storing breadboards, created in
[OpenSCAD][openscad] using
[**Gridfinity Rebuilt in OpenSCAD** by **kennetek**][gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad].

## Setup

See [the top-level README.md](/README.md) for libraries installation.

## Configuration

The breadboard size and number of breadboards are both configurable in the
OpenSCAD source model.

In the preconfigured model renders, the 4x4 3-breadboard holder is sized to fit
3 breadboards with 4 total power rails (instead of 6).
