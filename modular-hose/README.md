# Description

A flexible segmented hose makes a great air duct for my 3D printer enclosure
exhaust fan.

Inspired by several other
[terrific][flexible-segmented-hose-100mm-by-marius-hornberger]
[segmented][flexible-segmented-vacuum-hose-for-drill-press-by-martins-musings]
[hose][flexible-segmented-vacuum-hose-40mm-for-shopvac-by-teslapunk]
[models][parametric-momdular-hose-library-by-axford], I built my own segmented
modular hose model and library! I chose [OpenSCAD][openscad] so the software and
model would be fully open source.

## Setup
