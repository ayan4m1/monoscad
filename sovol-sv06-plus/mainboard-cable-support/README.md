# Description

Keep your Sovol SV06 or SV06 Plus extruder cable elevated with this cable
support! This remixes
[itsrouteburn's Sovol SV06 Plus Print Head Cable Support][original-model-url]
for better stability with a more snug fit.

## Printing

This prints with no supports and no special instructions.

## Installation

**Note:** The original model installs on the front side of the extruder cable.
This model is the opposite and installs on the back side of the extruder cable,
facing away from the printer.

First, turn off your printer. Open the mainboard case by removing the screw on
the rear.

Then, continue the installation with these instructions:

| Photo | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ![Photo of opened mainboard box](images/readme/photo-install-1.jpg) | Photo of opened mainboard box |
| ![Photo of support being inserted into the box lip](images/readme/photo-install-2.jpg) | Insert the printed support into the cable lip with the grooves facing the rear of the box |
| ![Photo of support inserted into the box lip](images/readme/photo-install-3.jpg) | Photo of support correctly inserted |
| ![Photo of dry fit zip tie](images/readme/photo-install-4.jpg) | Holding the extruder cable next to the support, thread a zip tie through the mainboard box lip holes, around the support and cable, and bath through the opposite hole |
| ![Photo of fastened zip tie](images/readme/photo-install-5.jpg) | Fasten the zip tie |
| ![Photo of closed mainboard box](images/readme/photo-install-6.jpg) | Close the mainboard box and re-install the screw |
| ![Photo of complete installation](images/readme/photo-installed.jpg) | Attach a second zip tie around the support and extruder cable using the upper notches on the support. Trim the zip ties excess. All done! |

## Differences of the remix compared to the original

I added grooves to and reduced the length of itsrouteburn's mainboard
box-mounted cable support model for better stability with a more snug fit.
