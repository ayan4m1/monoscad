# Description

Mount a camera to move with your Sovol SV06 or SV06 Plus' Z-axis with this screw
on mount! This part screws onto the the left side X-axis stepper motor housing,
and provides an attachment base for
[Sneaks' articulating camera mount system][original-model-url].

Models for both male and female articulated camera mount bases are provided.

## Hardware

A single M3 bolt is needed to attach the mount to the stepper motor housing.

## Printing and installation

These parts print as oriented in the model files with no supports and no special
instructions. Once printed, screw the part onto the left side X-axis stepper
motor housing using the M3 bolt. Then, attach something to the articulated
camera mount!

## Remixing

For further remixing, I've also included the blank piece I created to attach the
articulated camera mount links onto. These parts were created with TinkerCAD.

I used

with steel M5x20 bolts.

I used
[areyouferretti's articulated mount tripod bolt][areyouferretti-tripod-bolt]
to mount a Logitech C920 webcam to my articulated mount.
