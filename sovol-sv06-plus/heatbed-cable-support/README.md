This is a two-piece heat bed cable support set for the Sovol SV06 Plus when
placed near a wall

# Version 2

**Heat bed strain relief support V2 is here!**

I've been printing with the original bed strain relief support clip since I
published it a few months ago. The printer's original bed strain relief cover
that this fits onto is slightly wobbly. Once in a while, the bottom of the
looped zip tie would catch on the printer frame while moving to home, preventing
the bed from moving all the way back.

I redesigned this part from scratch to attach through the printer's strain
relief cover holes for a more stable fit!

# Description

In making an enclosure for my Sovol SV06 Plus, the heat bed cable would get
squashed against the rear wall when the bed moved to the far back (such as when
moving to home). I wanted the cable to be held upright without restricting the
motion of the bed.

To accomplish this, I modified
[rogerquin's Heatbed Cable Support for SOVOL SV06 / SV06+ 3d printer][original-model-url]
and added a support clip to fit over the heat bed cable strain relief cover.

In exploring solutions, I've learned the hot bed cable and strain relief
included with the SV06 Plus differs from those on the SV06, so these pieces may
not work on the SV06. The [OpenSCAD][openscad] source model and STL parts are
included for remixing.

## Hardware

You'll need 3 zip ties (2 of which should be small):

* 1 zip tie for the frame strain relief support clip
* Between 2 and 4 small zip ties for the bed strain relief cover support clip (I
  used 2)

## Printing

Both parts print oriented as is â€“ the frame support clip prints upright, and the
heat end bed support clip prints on its back side.

I recommend printing with a brim for the heat bed end support clip as the
contact surface area is low.

A brim for one or both parts may be needed depending on your bed adhesion.

## Installation

Both parts clip on and should be fastened with zip ties.

The frame support clip tilts into the printer frame slot. Attach a zip tie to the heat
bed cable on top of the clip to keep it in place.

The heat bed strain relief support clip fits over top of the existing SV06 Plus
strain relief cover. Secure it in place with a small zip ties:
* One zip tie through the top strain relief cover holes, looping around the heat
  bed cable on the bottom
* Another zip tie on the upright vertical heat bed cable support

If desired, zip ties can also be placed on the end of the strain relief cover
overlap, and on the middle of the support curve.

## Remixing

For further remixing, I've included the [OpenSCAD][openscad] source model for
the bed strain relief support clip. The source model uses the
[original Sovol SV06 Plus strain relief part][original-part-link-sv06-plus] for
fit and shapes of various components. With all of the source
files in the same directory, open `bed-strain-relief-support-v2.scad` in
OpenSCAD.

The included SV06 Plus strain relief cover STL files are repaired copies of
Sovol's original part (also included). The original part STL produced CGAL
errors in OpenSCAD.

## Previous version

[Heat bed strain relief support V1][bed-strain-relief-support-v1-stl]
was created in TinkerCAD, and is still included in the model files.
