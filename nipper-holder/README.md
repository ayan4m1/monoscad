Remixed holder for your 3D printer's included nipper cutter

# Description

This nipper cutter holder is great for storing the nippers that came with your
3D printer!

I added a closed tip onto
[Muh60's nipper cutter holder model][original-model-url]
to enclose the nipper blade for better safety.

I used [OpenSCAD][openscad] to modify the original model. The source code and
original models are included.

## Differences of the remix compared to the original

For better safety, I extended and closed the cutting end tip on the holder so
the blade would no longer be exposed.
